To use a supported theme, type theme: THEME-NAME, replacing THEME-NAME with the name of the theme as shown in the _config.yml of the theme's repository (most themes follow a jekyll-theme-NAME naming convention). For a list of supported themes, see "Supported themes" on the GitHub Pages site. For example, to select the Minimal theme, type theme: jekyll-theme-minimal.
